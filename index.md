# NHS STP Clinical Informatics [SBI1-3-23]

## About Clinical Informatics

[Clinical Informatics](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/healthcare-science/healthcare-science-specialisms-explained/informatics/clinical-informatics/) is the application of data and clinical knowledge to support healthcare delivery. This growing field bridges healthcare and technology, enhancing how healthcare data is captured and analysed. Within the NHS, it encompasses diverse applications from analysing clinical data and workflows to supporting healthcare IT system implementation. Clinical informaticians combine medical knowledge with technical expertise, using strong communication skills to translate between clinical needs and technical solutions.
