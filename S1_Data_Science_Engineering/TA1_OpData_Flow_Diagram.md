## Clinical Information Systems Details

- **EPIC Electronic Health Record**: Central repository for patient clinical information
- **Specialty clinical systems**: Specialized systems for specific departments (ICU, dialysis, cardiology)
- **Patient observation systems**: Capture vital signs and nursing observations
- **Digital imaging (PACS/RIS)**: Store and manage radiological images and reports

## Administrative Systems Details

- **Patient Administration System (PAS)**: Core system for patient demographics and encounters
- **Appointment scheduling**: Systems managing outpatient and procedure bookings
- **Patient registration**: Collection of patient demographic information
- **Bed management systems**: Track bed availability and patient placement

## Data Integration Processes

1. **Data extraction**: Regular extraction of data from source systems
2. **Data transformation**: Conversion to standardized formats
3. **Data loading**: Integration into data warehouse structure
4. **Quality validation**: Checks for completeness and accuracy
5. **Master data management**: Maintenance of consistent reference data

## Key Points for Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Data Analysis

1. **Hospital-Centric Data Collection**: The primary data sources are hospital clinical and administrative systems, with EPIC Electronic Health Record serving as the backbone of clinical data collection.

2. **Integrated Data Approach**: Data from various hospital systems is integrated through the data warehouse, enabling comprehensive analysis across clinical services.

3. **Bi-Directional Data Flow**: While hospital systems generate data for national datasets, these national datasets also provide benchmarking information that flows back to guide hospital operations.

4. **Multi-Purpose Data Usage**: The same source data serves multiple purposes, from direct patient care to operational management, research, and regulatory reporting.

5. **Data Governance Framework**: Robust information governance processes ensure appropriate use of data while protecting patient confidentiality.

6. **Supplementary Data Integration**: Hospital data is enhanced through integration with primary care, social care, and patient-generated information to provide a more complete picture of patient journeys.

7. **Quality Improvement Focus**: Data collection and analysis are aligned with the hospital's commitment to service improvement and excellence in patient care.

## Data Flow Implementation Challenges

- **System interoperability**: Different hospital systems using varying standards and formats
- **Data completeness**: Missing or incomplete data in source systems
- **Timeliness of data**: Delays in data availability for real-time decision-making
- **Skillset requirements**: Specialized expertise needed for complex data analysis
- **Legacy systems**: Older systems with limited integration capabilities
